## üé® THEME 1: Apple-Inspired Minimalist Luxury
**Branch:** `theme-apple-luxury`
**Use:** `switch-theme apple-luxury`

**Prompt to copy:**
```
Act as a Senior UX/UI Strategist from Apple's internal design team. Your task is to generate a complete CSS stylesheet that transforms the documentation website at [https://github.com/Deefunxion/draftV2/tree/theme-apple-luxury] into a premium, minimalist, and high-trust documentation experience. The final output must be clean, performant, and reflect Apple's core design principles.

Core Directives:

‚Ä¢ Layout & Spacing: Implement a CSS Grid-based layout with generous whitespace. Use padding: clamp(40px, 8vw, 120px); for section spacing. Ensure a strong visual hierarchy where the content is the undisputed hero.
‚Ä¢ Typography: Utilize a system font stack prioritizing 'SF Pro Display', 'Helvetica Neue', and other sans-serif fallbacks. Define a precise type scale using clamp() for fluid responsiveness. Headings must use font-weight: 600; and body text font-weight: 400; with letter-spacing: -0.015em; for improved readability.
‚Ä¢ Color Palette: Enforce a strict monochromatic scheme. Use #FFFFFF for backgrounds, #F5F5F7 for subtle section differentiation, and #1D1D1F for all text. A single accent color #0071e3 should be used exclusively for primary links and interactive state changes.
‚Ä¢ Interactivity & Animation: All transitions must be subtle and purpose-driven. Use transition: all 0.35s cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1);. Interactive elements on hover should have a minimal transform: translateY(-2px); and a soft box-shadow: 0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.08);.

Output Format: Provide a single, complete CSS file that replaces the current book-style.css. Include comments /* Critical: Navigation */ for essential viewport styles.
```

## üß† THEME 2: Conversion-Focused Psychological Nudge
**Branch:** `theme-conversion-psychology`
**Use:** `switch-theme conversion-psychology`

**Prompt to copy:**
```
Act as a Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) specialist with expertise in behavioral psychology. Your mission is to generate a CSS stylesheet for the documentation website at [https://github.com/Deefunxion/draftV2/tree/theme-conversion-psychology] that systematically applies visual cues and psychological triggers to guide users towards engaging with the content and completing their learning journey.

Conversion Directives:

‚Ä¢ Visual Hierarchy & Urgency: Primary navigation links must use a high-contrast background color (e.g., #FF7A00 or #28A745) that is used nowhere else. On hover, apply transform: scale(1.05); and an assertive box-shadow. For important sections, use a container with subtle attention-drawing styling.
‚Ä¢ Progress & Trust Signals: Style chapter completion indicators with clear visual progress. Add 'Chapter Complete' visual cues using ::before pseudo-elements with content: '‚úì'; and distinct colors.
‚Ä¢ Friction Reduction in Navigation: Navigation must have larger touch targets (minimum 44px), clear :focus states (border-color: #007AFF; box-shadow: 0 0 0 3px rgba(0,122,255,0.2);), and obvious visual feedback.
‚Ä¢ Content Anchoring: Style chapter numbers with increased prominence, main content with clear visual separation, and use color psychology to indicate progress (green for completed, blue for current, gray for upcoming).

Output Mandate: Deliver a complete CSS file. Add comments explaining the psychological principle behind each major rule (e.g., /* Completion Principle */, /* Visual Hierarchy: Attention */).
```

## ‚ö° THEME 3: Performance-First Core Web Vitals
**Branch:** `theme-performance-optimized`
**Use:** `switch-theme performance-optimized`

**Prompt to copy:**
```
Act as a Performance Engineer obsessed with Google's Core Web Vitals. Your sole objective is to refactor the CSS of the documentation website at [https://github.com/Deefunxion/draftV2/tree/theme-performance-optimized] to be exceptionally fast, efficient, and achieve a 'Good' score across LCP, INP, and CLS, without significantly altering the core readability.

Performance Mandates:

‚Ä¢ CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift) Prevention: All content sections must have explicit dimensions and use CSS Grid with fixed track sizes. Any dynamic content must have pre-defined container sizes using min-height properties.
‚Ä¢ LCP (Largest Contentful Paint) Optimization: Identify the LCP element (likely the main heading). Ensure its styles are minimal and placed at the very top of the CSS file. Use system fonts only for critical text. Web fonts for body text must use font-display: swap;.
‚Ä¢ INP (Interaction to Next Paint) & Animation Efficiency: All animations must be limited to transform and opacity properties. Use will-change: transform, opacity; sparingly and only on actively animated elements. Remove any complex hover effects that could cause paint thrashing.
‚Ä¢ Code Efficiency: Eliminate redundant selectors, consolidate utility classes, use efficient modern selectors over deeply nested ones. Minimize CSS file size while maintaining readability.

Output Requirement: Provide the refactored CSS with a commented 'Performance Report' section:
/* PERFORMANCE REPORT
   - Estimated CLS Reduction: Layout shifts eliminated through fixed dimensions
   - Estimated LCP Improvement: Critical path CSS prioritized
   - Key Changes: Removed complex animations, optimized selector efficiency

Core Directives:

‚Ä¢ Layout & Visual Narrative: Implement full-width sections with dramatic typography. Use CSS Grid to position content in cinematic compositions. Text must never overlay busy areas; use high-contrast backgrounds (background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);) to ensure 4.5:1 contrast ratio minimum.
‚Ä¢ Typography for Impact: Chapter headings should be large and impactful (font-size: clamp(2.5rem, 7vw, 4rem);) but body text must remain highly readable (font-size: clamp(16px, 1.8vw, 20px);) with line-height: 1.7;. Use dramatic font weights for hierarchy.
‚Ä¢ Scroll-Triggered Visual Interest: Use CSS-only techniques like clip-path and transform on scroll position to create reveal effects. Focus on fade-ins and upward movement that enhance, not distract from, content consumption.
‚Ä¢ Atmospheric Color Schemes: Use deep, rich colors that evoke learning and focus. Think library aesthetics with warm, inviting tones that encourage long reading sessions.

Output Mandate: Provide complete CSS with comments specifying the narrative purpose: /* Chapter Introduction: Setting the scene */.
```

‚Ä¢ Touch Targets: All interactive elements must have minimum 44px height with adequate spacing between them. Navigation items should have visual feedback on touch.
‚Ä¢ Progressive Disclosure: Content should be organized in expandable sections, allowing users to focus on one chapter at a time. Use clear visual indicators for expandable content.
‚Ä¢ Performance: No background images on large containers. Optimize for 3G networks. Animations should be minimal and CSS-only.

Output Mandate: Mobile-first CSS structure with mobile styles first, followed by @media (min-width: 768px) for larger screens.

  - Hover: Subtle lift (transform: translateY(-2px);) indicating interactivity
  - Active/Current Page: Distinct styling with visual indicator
  - Visited Sections: Subtle visual indication of completed reading
‚Ä¢ Reading Progress Indicators: Visual progress bars or indicators that show reading completion for each chapter. These should update based on scroll position using CSS-only techniques where possible.
‚Ä¢ Content Reveal Animations: When users scroll to new sections, content should have subtle entrance animations (opacity: 0 to 1 with transform: translateY(20px) to translateY(0)). 
‚Ä¢ Interactive Feedback: All clickable elements should provide immediate visual confirmation. Use swift animations (duration: 0.2s - 0.3s) with natural easing (cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)).

Output Mandate: Complete CSS with commented sections for each interaction type: /* Navigation States */, /* Progress Indicators */, /* Content Reveals */.

Core Directives:

‚Ä¢ Perceived Depth & Layers: Use transform: translateZ() and perspective on containers to create depth. Content cards should lift towards the user on interaction (transform: translateZ(20px);) with realistic shadows. Text must remain on the closest layer for clarity.
‚Ä¢ Spatial Navigation: Create floating navigation panels that appear to exist in 3D space. Use subtle rotation effects (transform: rotateY(5deg);) on hover that immediately revert to avoid disorientation.
‚Ä¢ Content Layering: Organize information in visual layers - background context, main content, and interactive elements - each with distinct z-index and visual treatment.
‚Ä¢ Clarity Maintained: Despite 3D effects, all text must remain perfectly flat and high-contrast. 3D effects apply only to containers and backgrounds, never to readable content.
‚Ä¢ Future-Ready Interactions: Design interactions that would naturally translate to AR/VR interfaces while working perfectly on current devices.

Output Mandate: Complete CSS with comments explaining 3D techniques and their purpose: /* Creates depth illusion without affecting readability */.

Core Architectural Directives:

‚Ä¢ Global Design Tokens: Define all design decisions as CSS variables at :root: colors (--primary-color, --text-color, --background), fonts (--font-family-heading, --font-family-body), spacing (--space-unit), and layout (--content-width, --line-height-body).
‚Ä¢ Component-Based Modularity: Structure CSS into clear component blocks (.chapter-header, .content-section, .navigation-menu). Each component should be self-contained and reusable across different page layouts.
‚Ä¢ Theme Variations: Create different theme modes using CSS classes on <body> (e.g., .theme-high-contrast, .theme-large-text) that override the root variables for different user needs.
‚Ä¢ Scalable Typography: Use CSS clamp() functions for all font sizes to ensure perfect scaling across devices while maintaining hierarchy.
‚Ä¢ Maintainable Structure: Organize CSS in logical sections with clear commenting. The system should be easily modifiable by future developers.

Output Mandate: Provide variable-based CSS with example theme overrides:
/* EXAMPLE: High-Contrast Theme
   body.theme-high-contrast {
     --text-color: #000000;
     --background: #FFFFFF;
     --primary-color: #0000FF;
   }
